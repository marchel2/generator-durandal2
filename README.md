##Development

### Run the Application

```shell
typings install
```

```shell
gulp watch

```
Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under `app` and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.
> This template uses [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for automated page refreshes on code/markup changes concurrently across multiple browsers. If you prefer to disable the mirroring feature set the [ghostMode option](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-ghostMode) to false
